HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Start tag	         Element content	                  End tag
<h1>	            My First Heading	                   </h1>
<p>	              My first paragraph.	                 </p>
<br>	               none	                             none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag!


Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Note: The content inside the <body> section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. 
The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

# HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

# HTML <mark> Element

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.


# Hide Content

4.Fourth item

# HTML Description Lists:
HTML also supports description lists.
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

HTML List Tags:
Tag	Description
<ul>	Defines an unordered list
<ol>	Defines an ordered list
<li>	Defines a list item

Value	Description
disc	Sets the list item marker to a bullet (default)

Lists can be nested
List items can contain other HTML elements
Use the CSS property float:left to display a list horizontally.

Type	        Description
type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers

# Control List Counting:
By default, an ordered list will start counting from 1. If you want to start counting from a specified number, you can use the start attribute:
# Nested HTML Lists
Lists can be nested (list inside list):
Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.

Use the HTML <ol> element to define an ordered list
