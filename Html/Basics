HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Start tag	         Element content	                  End tag
<h1>	            My First Heading	                   </h1>
<p>	              My first paragraph.	                 </p>
<br>	               none	                             none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag!


Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Note: The content inside the <body> section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. 
The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.


# HTML Formatting Elements:
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text

# HTML <b> and <strong> Elements:
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

# HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

# HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

# HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

# HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

# HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. 
Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

# HTML <sup> Element

Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

# HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 

# HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

# HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
