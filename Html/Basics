HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Start tag	         Element content	                  End tag
<h1>	            My First Heading	                   </h1>
<p>	              My first paragraph.	                 </p>
<br>	               none	                             none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag!


Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:


HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Note: The content inside the <body> section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. 
The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.


# HTML Formatting Elements:
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text

<sup> - Superscript text

# HTML <b> and <strong> Elements:
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

# HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

# HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

# HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

# HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

# HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. 
Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

# HTML <sup> Element
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. 
Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

# HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

# HTML Comments:
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.


# Hide Content
Comments can be used to hide content.
Which can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:

Note: You can also hide more than one line, everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.

# Hide Inline Content
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.


# HTML Colors:
HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.
In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name:

#Text Color:
You can set the color of text:

# Border Color:
You can set the color of borders:

# Color Values
In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.

The following three <div> elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values:
rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)

# HTML Lists
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.
Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:
An unordered HTML list:
.Item
.Item
.Item
.Item

Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
The list items will be marked with numbers by default:
An ordered HTML list:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
4.Fourth item

# HTML Description Lists:
HTML also supports description lists.
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

HTML List Tags:
Tag	Description
<ul>	Defines an unordered list
<ol>	Defines an ordered list
<li>	Defines a list item
<dl>	Defines a description list
<dt>	Defines a term in a description list
<dd>	Describes the term in a description list

# Nested HTML Lists-
Lists can be nested (list inside list):

# Unordered HTML List - Choose List Item Marker
The CSS list-style-type property is used to define the style of the list item marker. It can have one of the following values:
Value	Description
disc	Sets the list item marker to a bullet (default)
circle	Sets the list item marker to a circle
square	Sets the list item marker to a square
none	The list items will not be marked

# Use the HTML <ul> element to define an unordered list
Use the CSS list-style-type property to define the list item marker
Use the HTML <li> element to define a list item
Lists can be nested
List items can contain other HTML elements
Use the CSS property float:left to display a list horizontally.

# Ordered HTML List - The Type Attribute
The type attribute of the <ol> tag, defines the type of the list item marker:
Type	        Description
type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers


# Control List Counting:
By default, an ordered list will start counting from 1. If you want to start counting from a specified number, you can use the start attribute:
# Nested HTML Lists
Lists can be nested (list inside list):
Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.

Use the HTML <ol> element to define an ordered list
Use the HTML type attribute to define the numbering type
Use the HTML <li> element to define a list item
Lists can be nested
List items can contain other HTML elements

# HTML Other Lists
HTML also supports description lists.
HTML Description Lists
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

Use the HTML <dl> element to define a description list
Use the HTML <dt> element to define the description term
Use the HTML <dd> element to describe the term in a description list

# HTML Block and Inline Elements:
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
There are two display values: block and inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.
The <div> element is a block-level element.

The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot ><ul> <video>

# Inline Elements:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
Here are the inline elements in HTML:
<a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> <object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

# The <div> Element:
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

# The <span> Element:
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

There are two display values: block and inline
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
