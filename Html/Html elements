# HTML Paragraphs:
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>


# HTML Links:
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>


# HTML Images:
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

Example
<img src="myw3schoolsimage.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">


# HTML Elements:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>


# Nested HTML Elements:
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:
The <body> element defines the document's body.
It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>.
The <h1> element defines a heading.
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>


Note: Never Skip the End Tag
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:
In this example the end tag doesn't make any error.
<html>
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph
</body>
</html>


# Empty HTML Elements:
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:


# HTML is Not Case Sensitive.
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.


# HTML Tag Reference
Tag	        Description
<html>	        Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>	        Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings


# Html attributes: 
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


# The href Attribute:
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>


# The src Attribute:
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">


There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. 
Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.


The width and height Attributes:
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):
The alt Attribute:
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
The style Attribute:
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
The lang Attribute:
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
<html lang="en">
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
<html lang="en-US">
The title Attribute:
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Note:
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.
Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">


In short:
All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.
Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
Tag	       Description
<html>	       Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>	       Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>   Defines HTML headings
<p>	      Defines a paragraph
<hr>	      Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>	      Inserts a single line break
<pre>	      Defines pre-formatted text

# HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

HTML Horizontal Rules:
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

# HTML Line Breaks:
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

# The HTML <pre> Element:(Poem problem can be solved using pre i.e if u write a poem it will be displayed in single line but using pre this will not happen.)
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

# Background Color:
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

#Text Color:
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:

# Text Size:
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:
Example
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>

# Text Alignment:
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:
Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>

Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment
