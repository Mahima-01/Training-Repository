<!-- Create a script that prompts the visitor to enter two numbers and then shows their sum. -->
<script>
  let a = +prompt("The first number?", "");
  let b = +prompt("The second number?", "");

  alert( a + b );
</script>
<!-- Note the unary plus + before prompt. It immediately converts the value to a number.
Otherwise, a and b would be string their sum would be their concatenation, that is: "1" + "2" = "12". -->
