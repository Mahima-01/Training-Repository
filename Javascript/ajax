Ajax:
- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
- AJAX is not a programming language.
- AJAX just uses a combination of

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

- Ajax is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. 
- With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background

# Working of ajax:
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
