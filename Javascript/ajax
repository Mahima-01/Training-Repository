Ajax:
- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
- AJAX is not a programming language.
- AJAX just uses a combination of
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

AJAX, which stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously, which means that the browser doesn't need to reload the entire page when only a small bit of data on the page has changed. AJAX passes only the updated information to and from the server.

- Ajax is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. 
- With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background

# Working of ajax:
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

# AJAX - Examples:
Here is a list of some famous web applications that make use of AJAX
- Google maps
- Google Suggest
- Gmail

# AJAX: Synchronous or Asynchronous
AJAX can access the server both synchronously and asynchronously:
- Synchronously, in which the script stops and waits for the server to send back a reply before continuing.
Processing your request synchronously is similar to reloading the page, but only the requested information is downloaded instead of the entire page. 
Therefore, using AJAX synchronously is faster than not using it at all — but it still requires your visitor to wait for the download to occur before any further interaction with the page can proceed.

- - Asynchronously, in which the script allows the page to continue to be processed and handles the reply if and when it arrives.
Processing your request asynchronously avoids the delay while the retrieval from the server takes place because your visitor can continue to interact with the web page; the requested information will be processed in the background and the response will update the page as and when it arrives. 
Further, even if a response is delayed — for example, in the case of very large data — site visitors may not realize it because they are occupied elsewhere on the page.

Therefore, the preferred way to use AJAX is to use asynchronous calls wherever possible. This is the default setting in AJAX.
