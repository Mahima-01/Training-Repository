<!-- BOM (Browser Object Model)
The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.

For instance:
The navigator object provides background information about the browser and the operating system. There are many properties, but the two most widely known are: navigator.userAgent – about the current browser, and navigator.platform – about the platform (can help to differentiate between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).
The location object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one.

Here’s how we can use the location object -->

<script>
alert(location.href); // shows current URL
if (confirm("Go to Wikipedia?")) {
  location.href = "https://wikipedia.org"; // redirect the browser to another URL
}
</script>
