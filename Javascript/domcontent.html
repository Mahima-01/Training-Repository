<!-- DOMContentLoaded
The DOMContentLoaded event happens on the document object.

We must use addEventListener to catch it:

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
// not "document.onDOMContentLoaded = ..." -->

<!-- <script>
  function ready() {
    alert('DOM is ready');   
    // image is not yet loaded (unless it was cached), so the size is 0x0
    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
  }   
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
</script>   

<img id="img" src="https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0"> -->

<!-- window.onload
The load event on the window object triggers when the whole page is loaded including styles, images and other resources. 
This event is available via the onload property. -->
<!-- <script>
   window.onload = function() { // can also use window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
     alert('Page loaded');
  
     // image is loaded at this time
     alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
   };
  </script>
  
  <img id="img" src="https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0"> -->

<!-- window.onbeforeunload
If a visitor initiated navigation away from the page or tries to close the window, 
the beforeunload handler asks for additional confirmation.
If we cancel the event, the browser may ask the visitor if they are sure. -->
<!-- Ex-
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    return false;
  }; -->

<!-- readyState:
The document.readyState property tells us about the current loading state.

There are 3 possible values:
"loading" – the document is loading.
"interactive" – the document was fully read.
"complete" – the document was fully read and all resources (like images) are loaded too.
So we can check document.readyState and setup a handler or execute the code immediately if it’s ready.

function work() { /*...*/ }

if (document.readyState == 'loading') {
  // still loading, wait for the event
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', work);
} else {
  // DOM is ready!
  work();
}

// current state
console.log(document.readyState);
// print state changes
document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => console.log(document.readyState));
 -->

<!-- Page load events:

- The DOMContentLoaded event triggers on document when the DOM is ready. 
We can apply JavaScript to elements at this stage.

- Script such as <script>...</script> or <script src="..."></script> block DOMContentLoaded, the browser waits for them to execute.
- Images and other resources may also still continue loading.
-The load event on window triggers when the page and all resources are loaded. 
We rarely use it, because there’s usually no need to wait for so long.

- The beforeunload event on window triggers when the user wants to leave the page. 
If we cancel the event, browser asks whether the user really wants to leave (e.g we have unsaved changes).
- The unload event on window triggers when the user is finally leaving, in the handler we can only do simple things that do not involve delays or asking a user. 
Because of that limitation, it’s rarely used. We can send out a network request with navigator.sendBeacon.

- document.readyState is the current state of the document, changes can be tracked in the readystatechange event:
loading – the document is loading.
interactive – the document is parsed, happens at about the same time as DOMContentLoaded, but before it.
complete – the document and resources are loaded, happens at about the same time as window.onload, but before it. -->
