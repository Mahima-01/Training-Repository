What is Automation Testing?
Automation testing is a Software testing technique to test and compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome. 
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. 
This can be achieved by writing test scripts or using any automation testing tool. 
xTest automation is used to automate repetitive tasks and other testing tasks which are difficult to perform manually. 

-> Unit Testing:
Unit testing is testing the smallest testable unit of an application. 
It is done during the coding phase by the developers. 
To perform unit testing, a developer writes a piece of code (unit tests) to verify the code to be tested (unit) is correct
It is a good approach for projects which involve API and third-party tools.

-> TDD:
TDD stands for Test Driven Development. 
In this software development technique, we create the test cases first and then write the code underlying those test cases.
The teams that implement TDD, take more time for development.
TDD results in improved quality of code and the code that is more reusable and flexible.
In TDD the starting point is a test case.

Process Of TDD
TDD methodology follows a very simple 6 step process:
1) Write a test case: Based on the requirements, write an automated test case.

2) Run all the test cases: Run these automated test cases on the currently developed code.

3) Develop the code for that test cases: If the test case fails, then, write the code to make that test-case work as expected.

4) Run test cases again: Run the test cases again and check if all the test cases developed so far are implemented.

5) Refactor your code: This is an optional step. However, it’s important to refactor your code to make it more readable and reusable.

6) Repeat the steps 1- 5 for new test cases: Repeat the cycle for the other test cases until all the test cases are implemented.
Mainly it refers to write a test case that fails because the specified functionality doesn’t exist and after that update the code that can make the test case pass and as a result we get the feature implemented in the system.

-> BDD:
BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development. BDD is an extension to TDD where instead of writing the test cases, we start by writing a behavior. 
Later, we develop the code which is required for our application to perform the behavior.
The scenario defined in the BDD approach makes it easy for the developers, testers and business users to collaborate.
BDD is considered a best practice when it comes to automated testing as it focuses on the behavior of the application and not on thinking about the implementation of the code.

The process involved in BDD methodology also consists of 6 steps and is very similar to that of TDD.
1) Write the behavior of the application: The behavior of an application is written in simple English like language by the product owner or the business analysts or QAs.

2) Write the automated scripts: This simple English like language is then converted into programming tests.

3) Implement the functional code: The functional code underlying the behavior is then implemented.

4) Check if the behavior is successful: Run the behavior and see if it is successful. If successful, move to the next behavior otherwise fix the errors in the functional code to achieve the application behavior.

5) Refactor or organize code: Refactor or organize your code to make it more readable and re-usable.

6) Repeat the steps 1-5 for new behavior: Repeat the steps to implement more behaviors in your application.

It is a good approach for project development which are driven by user actions.
In BDD the starting point is a scenario.
Its main focus is on system requirements.

# Dynamic Attributes:
Most factory attributes can be added using static values that are evaluated when the factory is defined, but some attributes (such as associations and other attributes that must be dynamically generated) will need values assigned each time an instance is generated. 
These "dynamic" attributes can be added by passing a block instead of a parameter:

factory :user do
  # ...
  activation_code { User.generate_activation_code }
  date_of_birth   { 21.years.ago }
end
Because of the block syntax in Ruby, defining attributes as Hashes (for serialized/JSON columns, for example) requires two sets of curly brackets:

factory :program do
  configuration { { auto_resolve: false, auto_define: true } }
end

# Aliases:
factory_girl allows you to define aliases to existing factories to make them easier to re-use. 
This could come in handy when, for example, your Post object has an author attribute that actually refers to an instance of a User class. 
While normally factory_girl can infer the factory name from the association name, in this case it will look for a author factory in vain. 
So, alias your user factory so it can be used under alias names.

factory :user, aliases: [:author, :commenter] do
  first_name    "John"
  last_name     "Doe"
  date_of_birth { 18.years.ago }
end

factory :post do
  author
  # instead of
  # association :author, factory: :user
  title "How to read a book effectively"
  body  "There are five steps involved."
end

factory :comment do
  commenter
  # instead of
  # association :commenter, factory: :user
  body "Great article!"
end

Every Rails application you build has 3 sides: a side for production, a side for development, and a side for testing.
One place you’ll find this distinction is in the config/database.yml file. 
This YAML configuration file has 3 different sections defining 3 unique database setups:
production
development
test

# Unit Testing:
- Unit testing is a testing method where individual units of source code, program modules, usage procedures, and operating procedures are tested to determine if they are fit for use. 
- They make sure that a section of an application, or a “unit”, is behaving as intended. 
- In a Rails context, unit tests are what you use to test your models. 
Although it is possible in Rails to run all tests simultaneously, each unit test case should be tested independently to isolate issues that may arise. 
The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.

-> The Test Directory:
Rails automatically adds new test files to the models directory when new models are generated. 
So if you were to run a rails generate model User, Rails would add a user_test.rb file in the test/models directory. 
The unit tests will be written in these files for each model.

# Integration Testing:
- Integration tests are used to test the interaction among any number of controllers. 
- They are generally used to test important work flows within your application.
- Unlike Unit and Functional tests, integration tests have to be explicitly created under the ‘test/integration’ folder within your application. 
- Rails provides a generator to create an integration test skeleton for you.
$ rails generate integration_test user_flows
      exists  test/integration/
      create  test/integration/user_flows_test.rb

- With integration tests, your goal is to simulate a real-world scenario in which many units of code collaborate to deliver some value. 
- Another way to look at it is making sure all the units work together as a whole. 
That is because while each unit can function independently, it must also collaborate correctly with others.
