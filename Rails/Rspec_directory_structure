# Directory Structure:
RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, created for behavior-driven development (BDD). 
It is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby in production applications.
Specs are usually placed in a canonical directory structure that describes their purpose:

- Model specs reside in the spec/models directory

- Controller specs reside in the spec/controllers directory

- Request specs reside in the spec/requests directory. The directory can also be named integration or api.

- Feature specs reside in the spec/features directory

- View specs reside in the spec/views directory

- Helper specs reside in the spec/helpers directory

- Mailer specs reside in the spec/mailers directory

- Routing specs reside in the spec/routing directory

- Job specs reside in the spec/jobs directory

- System specs reside in the spec/system directory

Application developers are free to use a different directory structure. Inorder to include the correct rspec-rails support functions, the specs need to have the appropriate corresponding 
metadata :type value:

- Model specs: type: :model
- Controller specs: type: :controller
- Request specs: type: :request
- Feature specs: type: :feature
- View specs: type: :view
- Helper specs: type: :helper
- Mailer specs: type: :mailer
- Routing specs: type: :routing
- Job specs: type: :job
- System specs: type: :system
