Web Server vs Application Server:
A web server handles mainly HTTP protocols, the application server deals with several different protocols, including, but not limited, to HTTP.
The Web server's main job is to display the site content and the application server is in charge of the logic, 
the interaction between the user and the displayed content. The application server is working in conjunction with the web server, where one displays and the other one interacts.

A web server accepts and fulfills requests from clients for static content (i.e., HTML pages, files, images, and videos) from a website. 
Web servers handle HTTP requests and responses only.

An application server exposes business logic to the clients, which generates dynamic content. 
It is a software framework that transforms data to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application. 
Application servers enhance the interactive parts of a website that can appear differently depending on the context of the request.

Web server only handles Http request and response.i.e serves only web based applications.
Application Server serves both web(gmail) and enterprise base application(Erp, Crm)

Web Server doesn't support for multi-threading.
Application server Uses multi-threading to support multiple requests in parallel.
