SECRET_KEY is the key for encoding and decoding tokens.
Every time weâ€™re doing some encoding and decoding using JWT, we need to specify the SECRET_KEY.

self.encode function has 2 parameters. 
first payload and second exp
-Payload is a key-value object for holding data that want to be encoded. 
-exp stand for expiration for holding expiration time token. 
if exp is not specified it will give you the default value in 24 hours or one day.

In self.decode function we decoded the token given by the user and get the first value then assign it to a decoded variable, 
the first value contains a payload that we had already encoded before and the second value contain information about the algorithm that we use for encoding and decoding token.
