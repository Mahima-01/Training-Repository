# Schema in db folder in Rails project 
-It tends to be faster and less error prone to create a new instance of your applications database by loading the schema file via bin/rails db:schema:load than it is to replay the entire migration history.
-The format of the schema dump generated by Rails is controlled by the config.active_record.schema_format setting in config/application.rb. 
-By default, the format is :ruby, but can also be set to :sql.
-If :ruby is selected, then the schema is stored in db/schema.rb
-The Active Record way claims that intelligence belongs in your models, not in the database. 
-As such, features such as triggers or constraints, which push some of that intelligence back into the database, are not heavily use
Seeing the table of all the migrations done in the project 
-The db/schema.rb or db/structure.sql is a snapshot of the current state of your database and is the authoritative source for rebuilding that database. 
-This makes it possible to delete old migration files.
-When you delete migration files in the db/migrate/ directory, any environment where bin/rails db:migrate was run when those files still existed will hold a reference to the migration timestamp specific to them inside an internal Rails database table named schema_migrations. 
-This table is used to keep track of whether migrations have been executed in a specific environment.
-If you run the bin/rails db:migrate:status command, which displays the status (up or down) of each migration.
