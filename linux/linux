Client Server Architecture:
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

Linux:
Linux is an open-source operating system. It is like Windows, Mac, Android, etc.
Terminal in Linux is case sensitive to two file Test.txt and test.txt are different.
To see hidden folder in linux ctrl+h.

Directory Structure:
Create Folder
Delete Folder
Rename Folder
Moving Folder
Copying Files from folder
CP vs SCP

Linux commands:
1- pwd: Print working directory. It prints the path of the working directory, starting from the root.
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~$ mkdir Linux
Touch: Created the file named linus commands.
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~$ touch linux commands
This command has two flags.

    pwd -L: Prints the symbolic path.
    pwd -P: Prints the actual path.

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~$ pwd -L
/home/itsacheckmate
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~$ pwd -P
/home/itsacheckmate
itsacheckmate@itsachec

2- cd:cd command in linux known as change directory command. It is used to change current working directory. 

Syntax:  
$ cd [directory]
cd command in linux known as change directory command. It is used to change current working directory. 

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~$ cd ..
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:/home$ 

cd /: this command is used to change directory to the root directory, The root directory is the first directory in your filesystem hierarchy. 
$ cd /

cd ~ : this command is used to change directory to the home directory. 
$ cd ~
cd .. : this command is used to move to the parent directory of current directory, or the directory one level up from the current directory. “..” represents parent directory. 

cd “dir name”: This command is used to navigate to a directory with white spaces.Instead of using double quotes we can use single quotes then also this command will work. 
$ cd "dir name"

Purpose-  Deletes the folder  
Examples- rmdir is used to remove the emplty folder  
rmdir [-p] [-v | –verbose] [–ignore-fail-on-non-empty] directories 
here -p =>option each of the directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
 components will be removed, if they are already empty, starting from the last component
-v/-verbose => this option will show the verbose info
–ignore-fail-on-non-empty => this option will not report failure if the direcotry is not empty
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir a
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ ls
'a b'   b   git   Linux   PostgreSQL   README.md
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir 'a b' b

itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training$ rmdir -v a
rmdir: removing directory, 'a'

#####
rm - it is the remove command which deletes the objects such as files,directories , symbolic links etc.
and if the command has executed it cant be undone.
rm [option] .... FILE ...
rm a.txt deletes the a.txt file
rm -i a.txt => this asks for confirmation before deleting the file
rm -f a.txt => if the file is write protected it foces to delete it but wont work in the write protected directories
-r (recursive option)- it will perform a tree-walk and will delete all the files and sub-directories recursively
normally rm donot delete directory but using this option it will delete the directory
rm -r *

use -- before file name if file name starts with -
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name -       Rename Folder
Purpose-   Rename the named files according to regular expression perlexpr, can change name of multiple files

rename -s => it is going to ingnore the symbolic links
rename -v => verbose will show the files which is being renamed
rename -n=>if the user want  to see only final change
rename -o =>will not overwrite existing files
rename -V => shows the version
rename -help=> help message and exit
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b' a.txt
Substitution replacement not terminated at (user-supplied code).
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/Training/Linux/practice$ rename -v 's/a1/b/' a.txt

CP vs SCP
#scp or Secure Copy is primarily used to copy between a local host and remote host, or two remote hosts, via ssh
scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication
 and provides the same security as     ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.
# The cp command is for copying files locally, i.e. within your host's system.

Files
Name -       pwd
Purpose-    Print Working Directory				   pwd is shell built-in command(pwd) or an actual binary(/bin/pwd).
Examples- It has 2 options -[LP]
					pwd -L: Prints the symbolic path. it is default command shwon by pwd 
					Also by the $pwd variable value is shown
					pwd -P: Prints the actual path.It is the path shown by /bin/pwd
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/tmp$ pwd -L
/home/itsacheckmate/tmp
itsacheckmate@itsacheckmate:~/tmp$ pwd -P
/home/itsacheckmate/tmp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name -       chmod
Purpose-      Change the access mode of the file i.e what user have the permission on the file 
wether they can edit it, or read or execute the file or the directory .
Examples- Syntax is chmod [reference][operator][mode] file... 
Here the reference is whoh the permission apply it is represented by folloing letters
Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo
Then there is operator which specify how the modes of files should be adjusted
Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes
and the the modes which indicate which permission is to be granted
r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

the very first column represents the type of the file 
if its is a directory  'd' or if its a file the  '-'
then the folling 3set of letter represents the permission of the file owner
rwx =all three permission or rw- = only the read and write permission 

Then the following set off 3 letters are the group permission and other user permission
respectively 
if the directory has only x permission it means that there is premission to search the directory

Then it spescifies the owner and the group which owner belons to  
 Octal notaions could be used for this
 octal    binary   fileMode
 0			000			---
 1			001			--x
 2			010			-w-
 3			011			-wx
 4			100			r--
 5			101			r-x
 6			110			rw-
 7			111			rwx
 
 so for user,group,and other permission willl be written as
 - rwx--x--x => 711

Recursive Permission change - it is used to change the permission of multiple files in the 
directory at once   chmod -R is used with find command
Change all the files 
sudo find /path/to/someDirectory -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 644
change for all the directory
sudo find /path/to/someDirectory -type d -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 755

Sticky Bit - It applies only to the directory and specially used by the derictory which is publicly available 
it prevents the user to deleting and remaning any file which they do not personally own  for thsi 't' flag is used
chmod +t <directory>
chmod -t <directory>
